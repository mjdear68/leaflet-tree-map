# Introduction
The girths of 30 trees were measured in the Campbell Rhododendron Gardens, Blackheath, NSW. The measurements were made 1.4m from ground level and were recorded in centimetres. Photographs containing GPS and other ancilliary information were taken of each tree.

## Objective
The objectives (OB) of this analysis are to:

1. create an interactive map showing the location of each tree with the girth of each tree displayed as a roll-over popup
2. produce a boxplot and histogram of the girth measurements
3. provide a quantitative summary table of the girth measurements.
